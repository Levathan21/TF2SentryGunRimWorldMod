# TF2SentryGunRimWorldMod

"Hey look, buddy. I'm an engineer â€” that means I solve problems.
Not problems like 'What is beauty?' because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy.
I solve practical problems." -Engi 2007 

This is the TF2 sentry gun in Rimworld. it has stats that similar to the TF2 counter part but with Rimworld's balance in mind. 

The Turrets included are: Level 1, Level 2 and min sentry's. No plans to add level 3 i have looked at VEF framework but i need to learn how to use it first 
(I could make a version of the level 3 sentry that pretends that the sentry bullets are rockets that dont explode but do high damage) 

Cost for level 1:
130 Steel
3 Components 

Cost for level 2:
330 Steel
6 Components
15 Plasteel 

Cost for mini: 
100 Steel
1 Component

Level 1 and 2 do 16 damage per bullet
Mini dose 8 Damage
But each turret has downsides and upsides

Stats:

Level 1:
Decent Accuracy
Fires 4 bullets in a single burst
2 Second Cool-down between each burst
Uses 120 W
48% AP

Level 2:
Poor Long range accuracy
1 Second Cool-down between each burst
Fires 8 bullets in a single burst
Uses 240 W
48% AP

Mini:
Reduced Damage
Fires 2 bullets in a single burst
1.5 Second Cool-down between each burst
Great Accuracy
Uses 60 W
24% AP

Sorry combat extended is not supported.

Anyway enjoy my mod

Also this is inspired by Team Fortress 2. I have used 0 assets from Team Fortress 2 and ocarina0001 made the textures But Sounds are from vanilla Rimworld same with bullet textures.


(Update someone else made textures before me but never made a mod and they sent it over to me so we have some new fancy textures)
